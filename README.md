 Truevision Targa File View ".tga"
Truevision Targa File View ".tga" is a program written to read and 
display the image of a Truevision Targa file with a .tga extension.
Targa is a very simple image file to be read and displayed, in the 
code you can see.
There are simpler, easier, faster and more direct ways to load the 
file, but for now I have made use of a very large "switch(..)" for 
learning and better "structuring" read, perhaps allowing a better 
understanding of the file structure.
